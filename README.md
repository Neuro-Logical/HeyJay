# HeyJay!, a corpus of atypical speech with transcriptions and intent annotations.

Sharing of HeyJay! is done through a restricted-access repository. All  HeyJay! participants signed informed consent and approved data sharing. Researchers willing to access the data must send an email tjudy1@jhu.edu with the subject "[HeyJay] access to dataset". They will receive a data usage agreement (DUA) approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board that they will have to sign, explaining their research purposes. After the agreement is approved, researchers will receive access to the dataset.

HeyJay! has been deposited in ICPSR (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/) and will be available there soon. This Github page will be updated with the ICPSR link once the dataset is available there.
